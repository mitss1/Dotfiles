# Neovim Dotfiles

My Neovim setup

## Installation

Run the file [install](https://github.com/mitss1/Dotfiles/blob/master/install) to install correct path.

NB, might have to run ` chmod +x` command followed by the script name first.

```bash
chmod +x install
```

```bash
./install
```

You also need ripgrep and lazygit for telescope and lazygit to work.

They can both be installed via brew.
